To test singleplayer: run singleplayer.html
To test replay: Run replay.html
To test multiplayer: Start rtsServer.js using node and run multiroom.html. This file loads 3 instances of multiplayer and joines the room.

NOTE: To restart the multiplayer game, stop the server, close the browser window with multiroom.html, start the server and reopen multiroom.html
This is a bug that will be fixed soon :)


Issue list:

- Close rooms when only 1 player left.
- Detect disconnections and close rooms accordingly
- Send usernames to all users at startup
- Handle when a single player disconnects (dies or closes window) and keep the game running
- Prevent a minimized browser from piling up buffer by halting the games for all users in this case.
  This could be implemented using repeated messages from the client to the server.
  If this is the fix, local buffer of actions could be implemented as well.
